LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
private int x1 - This variable represents the x1-coordinate
private int x2 - This variable represents the x2-coordinate
private int y1 - This variable represents the y1-coordinate
private int y2 - This variable represents the y2-coordinate


Constructor
	public LinearEquation(int x1,int y1,int x2,int y2)

Methods

public void ToSlope()
Plug integer values into point slope form to determine the slope and y intercept.
Store the slope and y intercept as variables, make a final string containing the information.


public String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this instance including:
X and Y coordinate information
Slope Intercept Form equation



EquationRunner.java

Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 3: Use substring to convert coordinate points into 4 different variables.
Convert these variables from strings to integers.
Step 4: Construct an instance of the Linear Equation object.
Step 5: print the returned equation and info from the LinearEquation object.
Step 6: Ask the user for x input to plug in.
Step 7: Plug x input into final equation.
Step 8: Return y value.
